# polarsteps-unpacker

The official export from the service Polarsteps only gives you a single not-so-handy JSON file for all your data regarding a given trip. This is obviously not very convenient.

`polstarsteps-unpacker` is a utility to parse and convert said trip data to a formatted .docx document for your reading and archiving pleasure.
